The location of the resource. The location encoding is\nspecific to the service provider, and new encoding may be introduced\nas the service evolves.\n\nFor Google Cloud products, the encoding is what is used by Google Cloud\nAPIs, such as `us-east1`, `aws-us-east-1`, and `azure-eastus2`.

A resource\ncan be logically identified as \"//{resource.service}/{resource.name}\".\nThe differences between a resource name and a URI are:\n\n*   Resource name is a logical identifier, independent of network\n    protocol and API version. For example,\n    `//pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.\n*   URI often includes protocol and version information, so it can\n    be used directly by applications. For example,\n    `https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.\n\nSee https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names for details.","type":"string"},"service":{"description":"The name of the service that this resource belongs to, such as\n`pubsub.googleapis.com`.

UID is unique in the time\nand space for this resource within the scope of the service. It is\ntypically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource\nand must not be changed.

The timestamp when the resource was last updated. Any\nchange to the resource made by users must refresh this value.\nChanges to a resource made by the service should refresh this value.","type":"string","format":"DateTime"}}}
