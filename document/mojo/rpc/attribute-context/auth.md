| `principal` | `string` |  | N |  | The authenticated principal. Reflects the issuer (`iss`) and subject(`sub`) claims within a JWT. The issuer and subject should be `/`delimited, with `/` percent-encoded within the subject fragment. ForGoogle accounts, the principal format is:"https://accounts.google.com/{id}" |
| `audiences` | `Array<string>` |  | N |  | The intended audience(s) for this authentication information. Reflectsthe audience (`aud`) claim within a JWT. The audiencevalue(s) depends on the `issuer`, but typically include one or more ofthe following pieces of information:<br>-	The services intended to receive the credential. For example,
	["https://pubsub.googleapis.com/", "https://storage.googleapis.com/"].-	A set of service-based scopes. For example,
	["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"].-	The client id of an app, such as the Firebase project id for JWTs
	from Firebase Auth.<br>Consult the documentation for the credential issuer to determine theinformation provided. |
| `presenter` | `string` |  | N |  | The authorized presenter of the credential. Reflects the optionalAuthorized Presenter (`azp`) claim within a JWT or theOAuth client id. For example, a Google Cloud Platform client id looksas follows: "123456789012.apps.googleusercontent.com". |
| `claims` | `mojo.core.Object` |  | N |  | Structured claims presented with the credential. JWTs include`{key: value}` pairs for standard and private claims. The followingis a subset of the standard required and optional claims that wouldtypically be presented for a Google-based JWT:<br>{'iss': 'accounts.google.com','sub': '113289723416554971153','aud': ['123456789012', 'pubsub.googleapis.com'],'azp': '123456789012.apps.googleusercontent.com','email': 'jsmith@example.com','iat': 1353601026,'exp': 1353604926}<br>SAML assertions are similarly specified, but with an identity providerdependent structure. |
| `accessLevels` | `Array<string>` |  | N |  | A list of access level resource names that allow resources to beaccessed by authenticated requester. It is part of Secure GCP processingfor the incoming request.
