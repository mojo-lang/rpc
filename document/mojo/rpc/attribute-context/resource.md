| 字段 | 类型 | 格式类型 | 是否必须 | 默认值 | 说明 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | `string` |  | 否 |  | The name of the service that this resource belongs to, such as`pubsub.googleapis.com`. The service may be different from the DNShostname that actually serves the request. |
| `name` | `string` |  | 否 |  | The stable identifier (name) of a resource on the `service`. A resourcecan be logically identified as "//{resource.service}/{resource.name}".The differences between a resource name and a URI are:<br>-	Resource name is a logical identifier, independent of network
	protocol and API version. For example,
	`//pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.-	URI often includes protocol and version information, so it can
	be used directly by applications. For example,
	`https://pubsub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/123/topics/news-feed`.<br>See  for details. |
| `type` | `string` |  | 否 |  | The type of the resource. The syntax is platform-specific becausedifferent platforms define their resources differently.<br>For Google APIs, the type format must be "{service}/{kind}". |
| `labels` | `Map<string, string>` |  | 否 |  | The labels or tags on the resource, such as AWS resource tags andKubernetes resource labels. |
| `uid` | `string` |  | 否 |  | The unique identifier of the resource. UID is unique in the timeand space for this resource within the scope of the service. It istypically generated by the server on successful creation of a resourceand must not be changed. UID is used to uniquely identify resourceswith resource name reuses. This should be a UUID4. |
| `annotations` | `Map<string, string>` |  | 否 |  | Annotations is an unstructured key-value map stored with a resource thatmay be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br>More info:  |
| `displayName` | `string` |  | 否 |  | Mutable. The display name set by clients. Must be <= 63 characters. |
| `createTime` | `string` | `DateTime` | 否 |  | Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created. This maybe either the time creation was initiated or when it was completed. |
| `updateTime` | `string` | `DateTime` | 否 |  | Output only. The timestamp when the resource was last updated. Anychange to the resource made by users must refresh this value.Changes to a resource made by the service should refresh this value. |
| `deleteTime` | `string` | `DateTime` | 否 |  | Output only. The timestamp when the resource was deleted.If the resource is not deleted, this must be empty. |
| `etag` | `string` |  | 否 |  | Output only. An opaque value that uniquely identifies a version orgeneration of a resource. It can be used to confirm that the clientand server agree on the ordering of a resource being written. |
| `location` | `string` |  | 否 |  | Immutable. The location of the resource. The location encoding isspecific to the service provider, and new encoding may be introducedas the service evolves.<br>For Google Cloud products, the encoding is what is used by Google CloudAPIs, such as `us-east1`, `aws-us-east-1`, and `azure-eastus2`. Thesemantics of `location` is identical to the`cloud.googleapis.com/location` label used by some Google Cloud APIs. |
